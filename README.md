ObjectBox Go API
================
ObjectBox is a superfast database for objects.
Using this Golang API, you can use ObjectBox as an embedded database in your Go application.
A client/server mode will follow soon.

ObjectBox persists your native Go structs using a simple CRUD API:

```go
    id, err := box.Put(&Person{ FirstName: "Joe", LastName:  "Green" })
```

Want details? **[Read the docs](https://golang.objectbox.io/)** or
**[check out the API reference](https://godoc.org/github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go/objectbox)**.

Latest release: [v0.8.0 (2018-12-06)](https://golang.objectbox.io/)

Some features
-------------
* [Powerful queries](https://golang.objectbox.io/queries)
* Secondary indexes based on object properties
* Asynchronous puts
* Automatic model migration (no schema upgrade scripts etc.) 
* (Coming soon: Relations to other objects) 

Installation
------------
To get started with ObjectBox you can get the repository code as usual with go get 
and install the two prerequisites - pre-compiled library and a bindings generator.

```bash
go get github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go
go get github.com/google/flatbuffers/go
go install github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go/cmd/objectbox-gogen/

mkdir objectboxlib && cd objectboxlib
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-c/master/download.sh > download.sh
bash download.sh

```

See [installation docs](https://golang.objectbox.io/install) for more details and further instructions.

Additionally, you can run tests to validate your installation
```bash
go test github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go/...
```

Getting started
---------------
With the dependencies installed, you can start adding entities to your project:
```go
//go:generate objectbox-gogen
â€‹
type Task struct {
	Id           uint64
	Text         string
}
```
And run code generation in your project dir
```bash
go generate ./...
```
This generates a few files in the same folder as the entity - remember to add those to version control (e. g. git).

Once code generation finished successfully, you can start using ObjectBox:
```go
   obx := objectbox.NewBuilder().Model(ObjectBoxModel()).Build()
   box := BoxForTask(obx) // Generated function to provide a Box for Task objects
   id, _ := box.Put(&Task{ Text: "Buy milk" })
```

See the [Getting started](https://golang.objectbox.io/getting-started) section of our docs for a more thorough intro. 

Also, please have a look at the [examples](examples) directory and for the API reference see 
[ObjectBox GoDocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go/objectbox) - and the sources in this repo. 

Upgrading to a newer version
----------------------------
When you want to update, please re-run the entire installation process to ensure all components are updated:

* ObjectBox itself (objectbox/objectbox-go)
* Dependencies (flatbuffers)
* libobjectbox
* ObjectBox code generator

This is important as diverging versions of any component might result in errors.
  
This repository also come with a `install.sh` script that can be used for installation and upgrading:

 ```bash
~/go/src/github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go/install.sh
 ```
 
Afterwards, don't forget to re-run the code generation on your project
```bash
go generate ./...
```
